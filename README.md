# Mission-to-Mars

## Purpose
While using BeautifulSoup and Splinter, we are trying to scrape data about Mars's hemispheres. Specifically, we are trying to scrape full-resolution images of Mars's hemispheres and titles of those images. Also, we need to store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data via Flask, and make aesthetic decisions for the website to accommodate our new information.
